# From syndromic surveillance to data-driven surveillance

This is a collaborative effort to gather resources that can contribute to understanding and implementing _**data-driven surveillance**_.

**Remember that it is an open book - discussions and contributions are welcome! **\(the book is also available as a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nandadorea/DDSbook)\)



While I hope that a community of interested researchers and users will actively engage in suggesting topics and resources, the narrative here is strongly influenced by a personal journey. That journey started with the development of veterinary syndromic surveillance \(VSS\), and evolved into a belief that we should be moving beyond VSS and the early disease detection focus, towards a comprehensive framework of data-driven surveillance.

What exactly data-driven surveillance means will only become clear as we embark in the journey of building up this framework, which have only started to conceptualize. I hope others will join - this is a literal open book, contribute freely.
